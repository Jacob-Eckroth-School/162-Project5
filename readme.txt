This works pretty much as you'd expect. You can enter as many numbers as you want(as long as the number doesn't exceed 2147483647 in either direction.

It will push them to the end of the linked_list. Additionally there are some lines in my prog.cpp main that you can
uncomment if you want to test the functionality of push_back, push_forward, and insert. But they do work.

One thing I added that is not necessary is I printed out the time each sort algorithm takes after you choose whether you want it to be sorted ascending or descending.

I did the second extra credit option of using a recursive selection sort to sort the descending numbers.

To run the file, just type make and then type linked_list.
Enjoy!
